## Introduction
Aggregated, summarized, and simplified for your convenience.

What if I want information on a topic but don't want to scour through the entire internet to learn about it? 

Datafuse seeks to solve this problem by
- taking the user's search
- finding relevant articles and scraping them
- summarizing the articles
- presenting the summaries in a user friendly, stacked card layout. 

The goal is to consolidate news information from top ranked sites and provide an excerpt from each article for convenient reading. If the user is interested by the excerpt of the article, they can continue reading the full article by following the provided link. Additional options are being added intermittently, such as choosing an amount of results and filtering news sources based on impartiality.

## Technologies Used
- Backend: Django, Python
- Frontend: React/Redux, HTML/CSS
- Database/Caching: Redis
- Deployment: Heroku, Docker
- Miscellaneous: OpenAI GPT3.5, Google News Search API, BeautifulSoup.
