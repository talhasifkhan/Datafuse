<h4>Aggregated, summarized, and simplified for your convenience.</h4>
<br>
What if I want information on a topic but don't want to scour through the entire internet to learn about it? 
<br></br>
<b>Datafuse</b> seeks to solve this problem by:<br></br>
-  taking the user's input<br>
-  finding relevant articles<br>
-  scraping the articles<br>
-  summarizing the articles<br>
-  presenting the summaries in a user friendly, stacked card layout<br><br>

The goal is to consolidate news information from top ranked sites and provide an excerpt from each article for convenient reading. If the user is interested by the excerpt of the article, they can click the link to access the full article. 

Additional search options are also available, such as choosing an amount of results and choosing time frame of results.
